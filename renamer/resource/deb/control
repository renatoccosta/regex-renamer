Description: Rename your files the way you want in a batch process!
 Renamer is a tool to mass rename files given an expression.
 .
 Renamer is an extensible tool to rename files of a folder. It renames files
 based on a regular-expression to match patterns and replace with vales the user
 define. The values varies from constant expressions and a wide range of
 variable expressions like sequencers, file information, mp3 tags, and much
 more. It's also possible to create custom expressions and integrate them with
 Renamer with the plug-in APIs.
