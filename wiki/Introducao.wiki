Regex-renamer was built to be a flexibe and extensible tool to rename files of a
folder.

It uses regular expressions to search for file patterns (called search 
expression). The files that matches the pattern are renamed based on another
expression (called replace expression). This expression is constructed using a
simple language that was based on EL (expression language) to tell Regex-renamer
how to replace the file names.

The replace expressions can be divided into two categories:
  * Constant Expressions;
  * Variable Expressions

Constant expressions are string literals that will be used in the new file name.
Variable expressions are special code able to perform a wide range of functions
like generate number sequences, obtain file information, query id3 tags, etc,
and use this info on the new file name.

The architecture of the Regex-renamer allows it's variable expression library to
be extended and add new functionalities to the application. The API provides the
needed interfaces to do this.
